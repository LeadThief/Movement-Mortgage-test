## Build:

Hi All,

Here is my Movement Mortage profile landing page.
I built the front end with React js and SCSS, for the back end I used a headless CMS called graphcms I entered all the data into their back end and called GraphQl queries from my react components. If we want to pursue with a headless CMS we can build our own back end with vue js, react, or angular.
I used npm for my build tool if you download to code you need to install the dependencies first (npm install) then for the dev server run "npm run watch". I created a build, first install "npm install - g serve" than run "serve -s build". Let me know if something is broken.
